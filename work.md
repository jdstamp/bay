    description: In my work as PhD student I developed the multivariate MArginal ePIstasis Test (mvMAPIT) – a multi-outcome generalization of a recently proposed epistatic detection method which seeks to detect marginal epistasis or the combined pairwise interaction effects between a given variant and all other variants. By searching for marginal epistatic effects, one can identify genetic variants that are involved in epistasis without the need to identify the exact partners with which the variants interact – thus, potentially alleviating much of the statistical and computational burden associated with conventional explicit search based methods.

    description: I worked as software consultant for one of the biggest German insurance companies. As part of the build management team for several software projects, I worked on setting up an entirely new build infrastructure with automation of continuous integration, testing, delivery, and release management in the cloud. Our team was basically performing open-heart surgery on critical infrastructure that was in permanent use by all the software teams depending on it, with the goal of better reliability, automation, and cost efficiency. The main technologies I worked with were Groovy Shell, Docker, Git, Maven, Openshift, Cloudfoundry, Jenkins, Nexus

    description: For my masters thesis I joined the <a href="https://www.biosystems.physik.uni-muenchen.de/">Systems Biophysics AG Braun</a>. I worked on templated ligation as possible pathway for non-enzymatic replication. I also worked on prototyping an experimental setup for realtime spectroscopy in thermophoretic traps. I learned hot to use Comsol to simulate thermal traps, LabView to simulate random motion of particles in flow fields and temperature gradients, and how to experimentally realize these simulations. Major technolohgies I worked with were HPLC-MS, Bioanalyzer, UV-spectroscopy.

I obtained a Master of Science degree in Physics and Biophysics from Ludwig Maximilian University, Munich. I worked as software Consultant for TNG Technology Consulting, Munich, before returning to academia in pursuit of a doctorate degree in Computer Science and Computational Sciences at Brown University.
