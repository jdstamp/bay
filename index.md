<p>
  I am a researcher pursuing a PhD in computer science and computational sciences at the Center for Computational Molecular Biology at Brown University. I am a member of the <a href="http://www.lcrawlab.com/">Crawford Lab</a> and the <a href="https://www.brown.edu/research/labs/weinreich/">Weinreich Lab</a>.
  My research focuses on developing statistical methods to study the genetic architecture of complex traits and how nonlinear interactions between multiple genes and between genes and the environment shape evolution.

  When I am not working, I enjoy running, traveling, and recently gardening.
